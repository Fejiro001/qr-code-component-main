## My process

### Built with

- Responsive Web Design
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Created the look of the card using flexbox. Added margin to create space between the device and the card.

```css
.card {
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: column wrap;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 1rem;
  margin: 0.5rem;
  border-radius: 1rem;
  max-width: 18rem;
  text-align: center;
}
```
### Continued development

Continue to create more projects implementing on responsiveness and flexbox.

### Useful resources

- [Wrapping Text](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_text/Wrapping_breaking_text) - This helped me know how to break my sentences using CSS. I like that this site also provides examples with their code.
